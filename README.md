AIM:
In this experiment, you are expected to develop a flight search engine (such as skyscanner
(www.skayscanner.com/) or e-dream (www.edreams.com/)) that enables users to make flight plans. The
flight database will be provided via two input files. Your program should read these input files and create a
directed graph structure to store the information. Finally, your program should create output files according
to information given two input files. In this section, details will be given about the input files to be used
and the output file to be created.
